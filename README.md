# SQL-Netflix_database

# Netflix Database Analysis Project

This project is an analysis of the Netflix database using SQL. The project focuses on the dataset obtained from the Netflix csv file. 
The dataset was cleaned in Excel and then imported into a PostgreSQL database using pgAdmin 4.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project was downloaded from Kaggle and contains information about movies and TV shows available on Netflix. 
It includes attributes such as show ID, type, title, director, cast, country, date added, release year, rating, duration, listed in, and description.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to perform various SQL queries and analysis on the Netflix dataset to gain insights into the content available on the platform.

## Technologies Used

- SQL: Used for querying and analyzing the Netflix database.
- Excel: Used for data cleaning and preprocessing.
- pgAdmin 4: Used as the database management tool to create a new table and import the cleaned dataset.

## Usage

To run the SQL queries and perform analysis on the Netflix database, follow these steps:

1. Set up a PostgreSQL database using pgAdmin 4.
2. Create a new table in the database.
3. Open your preferred SQL client and connect to the database.
4. Execute the SQL queries to perform analysis on the Netflix dataset.


## SQL Queries

The project includes a set of SQL queries that explore various aspects of the Netflix dataset. These queries cover areas such as:

- Basic data exploration
- Filtering and sorting
- Aggregation and grouping

## Conclusion

This project provides an overview of the Netflix database and demonstrates how SQL can be used to analyze the dataset. By applying SQL queries, we can gain valuable insights into the content available on Netflix.

Feel free to explore the project and adapt the queries to suit your own analysis needs.
